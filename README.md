Toy-C-Compiler-Frontend
====
A Compiler front end to produce code for llvm backend

## Introduction

* This is a toy-project to build an easy C Compiler frontend
* Develop using TDD
* Using standard C++11
* Will Support cross-platform

## Plan

Here is the plan of this toy-project

- [ ] Write testcases for the project
- [ ] 

## How to contribute

* Just make Pull Request ~
 * the commit format is : "codemodulename: What you do"
 
  > For example , you add A function foo into the grammer anaylze module then your commit should
   look like this : grammar anaylze: Add function foo XXXXXXXXXXXXX
* Be aware of the code styling , see the sample code to make sure you obey the code styling

Sample Code : [link](http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html)
